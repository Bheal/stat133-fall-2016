## `"dplyr"` introductory tutorials

Look at __dplyr__'s vignette: [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)

Here's another `"dplyr"` tutorial: [Data Manipulation with dplyr](http://datascienceplus.com/data-manipulation-with-dplyr/)

## Bay Area Bike Accidents

Get a copy of the data set `bike-accidents.csv` from the course's github 
repo.


### Exploring one single variable

Use `"dplyr"` to find the following information (store the results in separated
data frames so you can use them later with `ggplot()`):

- Number of accidents per County
- Number of accidents per Month
- Number of accidents per Hour

Use `ggplot()` to get: 

- a bar chart (in decreasing order) of the number of accidents per County.
- a bar chart of the number of accidents per Month (months must be arrange
in the way they appear in the calendar: Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
- a line chart of the number of accidents per Hour.


### Exploring two variables

Use `"dplyr"` to find the following information (store the results in separated
data frames so you can use them later with `ggplot()`):

- Number of accidents per Month, by County
- Number of accidents per Hour, by Month

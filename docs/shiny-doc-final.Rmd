## Introduction to Shiny

Please select a name to explore.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput(
  inputId = "name", 
  label = "Name:", 
  value = "Gaston")
```

Here is a graph of the number of people named `r renderText(input$name)`.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
library(babynames)
library(ggplot2)

# subset data inside a reactive object
# (in this way it is available to render functions)
names <- reactive({
  subset(babynames, name == input$name)
})

renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = names(), aes(x = year, y = n)) + 
    geom_line(size = 1, aes(color = sex)) +
    theme_bw()
})
```

`r renderText(input$name)` was more popular than ever in 
`r renderText(names()$year[which.max(names()$n)])`. 

So far `r renderText(sum(names()$n))` people have
been named `r renderText(input$name)`.
